Q1: Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in the worst-case scenario. It allows us to classify algorithms according to how their performance scales with input size.

Rules of Big O Notation

1. Constant Time - O(1):
   - The algorithm takes a fixed amount of time regardless of the input size.

2. Linear Time - O(n):
   - The time complexity grows linearly with the size of the input.

3. Quadratic Time - O(n^2):
   - Time complexity increases quadratically with input size. Common in nested loops.

4. Logarithmic Time - O(log n):
   - Time complexity grows logarithmically. Common in divide-and-conquer algorithms.

5. Drop Constants and Lower Order Terms:
   - Ignore constant coefficients and non-dominant terms.
